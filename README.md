# Basic Go

-   go test -bench=.
-   `go test -cover`
-   `go test ./... -cover`
-   In Go if a symbol (variables, types, functions et al) starts with a lowercase symbol then it is private outside the package it's defined in.
-   go install github.com/kisielk/errcheck@latest
    -   package to help identify errors that have not been checked
    -   `errcheck .`
